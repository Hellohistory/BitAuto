# 🌐 Introduction to Titan Network  

**Titan Network** is a digital resource network designed to match community idle resources with global demand, allowing everyone to easily leverage the power of **DePIN services** and contribute to the construction of the **Value Internet**.  

## 💡 What is Titan Network?  

Titan Network has developed a universal **DePIN service platform** that enables communities to aggregate or deploy hardware resources to provide interchangeable digital resources such as **computing, storage, and bandwidth**.  

Its **built-in economic incentive mechanism** and **network design** ensure that the community is rewarded for contributing resources while delivering **advanced, reliable, and high-quality cloud solutions** to end users.  

🔹 **Openness**: Open-source & low-entry barrier, allowing the ecosystem to participate and benefit easily.  
🔹 **L1 Blockchain**: Coordinates the community-built **fog resource network**.  
🔹 **Node Types**:  
   - **Lightweight Edge Nodes** (compatible with ultra-lightweight hardware such as mobile phones)  
   - **Guardian Nodes** (responsible for heavy computing & task scheduling)  
   - **Validator Nodes** (running consensus and scheduling tasks on the main chain)  

This architecture enables **decentralized and open-source** cloud services while supporting **DePIN services** such as **hot storage, CDN acceleration, and verifiable random functions**. Additionally, Titan Network provides **trusted storage** and **trusted container execution environments** based on **decentralized networks**.
